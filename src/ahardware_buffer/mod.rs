//! Android `AHardwareBuffer` import.
//!
//! Android producers — `AImageReader` with GPU usage, `MediaCodec`,
//! `SurfaceControl` — hand out frames as `AHardwareBuffer`s. Vulkan imports
//! one through `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer`. When the
//! driver maps the buffer to a Vulkan format, `wgpu` adopts the resulting image
//! through its `hal` layer, so the returned texture *is* the producer's buffer:
//! no pixel is copied, by the CPU or the GPU. When the driver describes it only
//! through an external format, a GPU pass copies its planes into textures
//! `wgpu` owns ([External formats](#external-formats)); no pixel passes
//! through the CPU either way.
//!
//! # Device
//!
//! The import needs device extensions `wgpu` does not enable by itself
//! ([`DEVICE_EXTENSIONS`]) and the `samplerYcbcrConversion` feature, with
//! which external formats are converted. Open the device with
//! [`request_device`], or add them with [`DeviceRequirements`] in
//! `wgpu-hal`'s device-creation callback when a renderer opens its device
//! itself.
//!
//! # Formats
//!
//! The format comes from the Vulkan driver's own reading of the buffer
//! (`vkGetAndroidHardwareBufferPropertiesANDROID`), not from the buffer's
//! description, and decides what [`HardwareBufferImporter::import`] returns:
//!
//! | Vulkan format the driver reports | [`ImportedHardwareBuffer`] | Textures |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` (`R8G8B8A8_UNORM`, `R8G8B8X8_UNORM` buffers) | [`Rgba`](ImportedHardwareBuffer::Rgba) | one `Rgba8Unorm` texture that aliases the buffer |
//! | `G8_B8R8_2PLANE_420_UNORM` (`Y8Cb8Cr8_420` buffers, when the driver maps them) | [`Ycbcr420`](ImportedHardwareBuffer::Ycbcr420) | the `Plane0` and `Plane1` views of one `NV12` texture that aliases the buffer |
//! | `UNDEFINED`, with an implementation-defined *external format*, for a `Y8Cb8Cr8_420` buffer (camera frames and many allocated YCbCr buffers) | [`Ycbcr420`](ImportedHardwareBuffer::Ycbcr420) | an `R8Unorm` and an `Rg8Unorm` texture, converted from the buffer on the GPU |
//!
//! Both kinds of [`Ycbcr420Planes`] read the same way: a full-resolution luma
//! plane sampled as `R8Unorm`, a half-resolution plane of interleaved Cb/Cr
//! pairs sampled as `Rg8Unorm`, holding the stored codes, together with the
//! [`YcbcrEncoding`] the driver reports for the buffer.
//! The aliased `NV12` texture needs `wgpu::Features::TEXTURE_FORMAT_NV12` on
//! the device.
//!
//! # External formats
//!
//! Many drivers describe 4:2:0 YCbCr buffers only through an external format,
//! which can be read only through a sampler carrying a
//! `VkSamplerYcbcrConversion`; on some drivers, such as the Mali-G715's, that
//! is every such buffer, camera frames included. `wgpu` cannot express that
//! sampler, so the import samples the buffer in a small raw Vulkan pass,
//! submitted on the importer's queue, that writes the stored codes into two
//! textures `wgpu` owns. No pixel passes through the CPU. The pass needs only
//! the `samplerYcbcrConversion` feature, which every import requires. It binds
//! the buffer through a descriptor set from a pool sized for one combined
//! image sampler with a YCbCr conversion:
//! `maxCombinedImageSamplerDescriptorCount` descriptors where the device
//! reports it (`VK_KHR_maintenance6`), and otherwise 3, one per plane, which
//! suffices on every known driver but is not guaranteed by the specification;
//! a driver that needs more is reported as
//! [`HardwareBufferImportError::ConversionDescriptorPool`]. Only
//! `Y8Cb8Cr8_420` buffers are converted, since
//! only their format says the samples are 8-bit 4:2:0; an external-format
//! buffer of any other format, such as
//! `YCbCr_P010`, is rejected with [`HardwareBufferImportError::ExternalFormat`].
//! The pass exists only because `wgpu` has no YCbCr sampler; once it gains
//! one, these buffers import directly.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! A [`HardwareBufferFrame`] holds a reference on the buffer, the producer's
//! acquire fence, and its [`HardwareBufferLease`]. Importing consumes the
//! frame:
//!
//! 1. The lease is told the frame was
//!    [presented](HardwareBufferLease::presented), and the import submits the
//!    acquire of the buffer from the producer's (foreign) queue family, which
//!    waits on the acquire fence on the GPU — together with the conversion,
//!    for an external format.
//! 2. Once nothing reads the buffer any more, the Vulkan objects and the
//!    buffer reference are released, and finally the lease, which hands the
//!    buffer back to the producer. For an aliasing import that is when its
//!    texture has been dropped and every submission that used it has
//!    completed; for a converted one, when the conversion has completed,
//!    whatever the caller does with the planes.
//!
//! Neither path lets the GPU write the buffer, so the producer gets back
//! exactly what it wrote.
