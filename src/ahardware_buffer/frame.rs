// SAFETY: `HardwareBufferRef` is not `Send` only because it wraps a raw
// pointer. An `AHardwareBuffer` is a reference-counted NDK object whose
// acquire, release, and describe entry points are thread-safe: the NDK
// documents hardware buffers as shareable across threads and processes, and
// the reference count is atomic. This type only ever releases its reference
// (on drop) and hands out the pointer to Vulkan, so moving it to another
// thread — the one on which `wgpu` destroys the imported texture — is sound.
